# Data Folder

This folder contains datasets used in the course.

## Structure

- Place raw data files here
- Data should be well-documented
- Consider including a data dictionary for complex datasets

## Guidelines

- Do not commit large data files (>100MB) directly to the repository
- For large datasets, consider using Git LFS or providing download links
- Always include metadata about data sources and collection methods
